# ***** IMPORTANT NOTES FOR REBUILDING GAME FROM GITHUB: ****    #
#                                                                #

# YOU WILL NEED TO DOWNLOAD AND IMPORT THE FOLLOWING PACKAGES AND FREE ASSETS FROM EITHER PACKAGE MANAGER,
# OR THE UNITY ASSET STORE (DO WITH THE MAIN SCENE "Zombie City" being OPEN IS BEST)
#
# PACKAGE MANAGER:  
# Unity's "Terrain Tools" package
# Unity "Terrain Sample Asset Pack" V2.0.1
# TextMeshPro (but no need to import any samples using the samples button) V3.06
#
# Also uses - Unity "Universal Render Pipeline V12.1.10"
#
# Cinemachine (if not already installed on your PC)
# Input Manager (should be installed already I believe)
#
# ASSET STORE PACKAGES:
# "Nature Low-Poly pack" by TEXTHEMESS,  V1.0
# "Modular Lowpoly Streets (Free)" by EVPO Games, V1.0
# "Medieval Bridge 3D" by ANDREICG, V1.0
# "VIS - PBR Grass Textures" by Vis Games, V1.1
# "Stones" by Pixelcloud, V1.0
# "AllSky Free - 10 Sky / Skybox Set" by rpgwhitelock, V1.1.0
# "RPG/FPS Game Assets for PC/Mobile (Industrial Set v2.0)" by Dmitrii Kutsenko, V2.0
# "Asphalt Materials" by VK GameDev, V1.0
# "Rock and Boulders 2" by MAnufactura K4, V1.2
# 
#
#  IMPORTANT NOTE:  IN A LOT OF THESE ASSETS, YOU WILL NEED TO UPDATE THE MATERIALS (the dreaded PINK Assets in Scene!) TO USE
#  THE URP (Universal Render Pipeline)!
#
#  This is done by selecting the material, then going to "Edit -> Rendering -> Materials -> Convert Selected built-in Material to URP" and clicking Update
#  The following packages will need this to be done (at time of writing):
#  Asphalt Materials, Stones, Medieval Bridge, RPG Game Assets, Lowpoly Streets, RPG/FPS Game Assets for PC/Mobile (Industrial Set v2.0) 
#  - Just the "Industrial buildings/Hangers" folder, and Rocks (the "Unity 5" materials only!).
#
#  IN ADDITION: It is quite possible that the colour on SOME of the GUI buttons may not be set correctly, also in the UI score display, 
#  and be the default white colour, I have no idea why, with the TextMeshPro package - just set them to yellow or whatever colour u fancy!
